            <p>
                I've spent the last few years learning to program. I have a CS degree from the University of Washington, but learning a new language or technology every class has left me a Jack-of-all-Trades, Master-of-None. Once the pandemic hit, I saw it as an opportunity to finally hone it in and work towards a career.

                I may not have any professional experience, but I strive to put my heart and soul into every project I create. Even with small applications, you can find me researching color theory or something of the ilk to ensure a great experience. When in between class assignments, I try to work on my excessively large list of project ideas, ranging from the silly idiom confuser to full dagashi databases.
            </p>
            <p>
                When not behind the keyboard, I can be found playing games, fangirling over the MCU, binging yet another anime, or petting my kitten Lilith.
